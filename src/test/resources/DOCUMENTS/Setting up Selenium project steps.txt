Setup steps

## Setup Maven, testNG and Cucumber framework ##

(1) New Maven Project
(2)Update POM file with dependencies such as Cucumber, TestNG and Selenium and add reference to trigger testng.xml file
(3)Convert project to testNG, to generate testng.xml file
(4)Create the 'Feature' folder in the 'test > resource' directory, here will live all feature files
(5)Create the RunCucumber.class, which extends the AbstractTestNGCucumberTests 
	Uses @CucumberOptions annotation to give location of feature files or folder and test output format.
(6)Create the ListenerCucumber.class, which implements the IExecutionListener
	Use onExecutionFinish method to generate the masterthought report. it executes class GenerateReport
(7) Create the GenerateReport.class. It's generic so can be pasted from an existing project.  
(8) Create the StepDefininion.class. This will contain the Selenium code, and the cucumber annotation which link to the feature file content.

## Add the feature files which will drive the testing via RunCucumber.class and StepDefininion.class ##

(1) Run the build after feature files have been added. The console output will give useful examples to populate the StepDefininion.class

(2) Copy and paste the example into StepDefininion.class and modify to suite your needs. 
(3) Re-run test and evaluate output report.
